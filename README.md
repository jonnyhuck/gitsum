# gitsum
Produce a summary of a number of characteristics of a git repository

#### Notes
* I thought that a version that didn't require porcelain might perform better - but this is not the case (it takes ~2.5x as long to analayse the [Paper2GIS](github.com/jonnyhuck/Paper2GIS) repo). This slower version is available for comparison in the [noporcelain](https://github.com/jonnyhuck/gitsum) branch.
